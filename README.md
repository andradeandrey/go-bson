Go-BSON
=======

Go-BSON is a [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/) encoder and decoder package for the [Go
programming language](http://golang.org/). It is primarily intended to be used
with [Mongogo](mongogo).

This project is still in development. It's not well tested, but the basics seem to
work well enough.

Usage
-----

Go-BSON has two main functions: one that encodes and one that decodes.

Encode:

    doc := bson.Doc{"hello": "world"}
    data, err := bson.Marshal(doc)

Decode:

    // data is a []byte value that contains BSON data
    doc, err := bson.Unmarshal(data)

The package also provides some types that allow encoding of BSON data that
cannot be represented by Go types, including:

    JavaScript
    MaxKey
    MinKey
    ObjectId
    Regexp
    Symbol

Clients may create additional types that can be BSON-encoded by implementing
the Marshaler interface. See the documentation in the source for more information.

Contributing
------------

Simply use GitHub as usual to create a fork, make your changes, and create a pull
request. Code is expected to be formatted with gofmt and to adhere to the usual Go
conventions -- that is, the conventions used by Go's core libraries.
